# Recap — Synthesis Rules (Reminder)
- **Format**: Return a single **Markdown newsletter** only, no JSON or commentary.
- **Language**: All the final markdown content should be in {{ lang }}.
- **Sections**: Headlines, Products & Releases, Research & Benchmarks, Policy/Security & Safety, Developer Changelogs, Quick Hits (omit empty ones).
- **Item micro-format**:
  - **[Title](URL)** — 1–2 sentences (28–60 words), factual, present tense, light witty aside optional.
  - Always end with `(source_domain, Mon DD)`. Append `(paywalled)` if applicable. Add region/language tags if needed.
- **Ranking**: High significance first → medium → low (only if completes a story). Deduplicate by `story_id`; keep canonical (usually official) URL.
- **Freshness**: Prefer items closest to {{ time }}.
- **Accuracy**: Never invent facts; use only collected items.
- **Links**: Double-check every link is present, canonical (no tracking params), and correct. Broken or missing links = unusable output.
- **Novelty**: Skip items already in **History**, unless they clearly advance an ongoing story.
- **Tone**: Concise, direct, lightly witty, but sober on security/regulation.
- **Output**: Begin with `# {{ topic }} — Daily Briefing ({{ time }})`, optional 1–2 sentence intro, then sections with bullets.
