## Concise Hierarchical Markdown Study Notes Prompt

**Role:**
Transform the given text into **concise, structured study notes** in markdown with emojis. Headings represent the **main nodes** of the content.

**Rules:**
- Output only markdown — `#` for main topic, `##` for main sections, `###` for subpoints (max depth: 3).
- Main topic: exactly **1 heading** (`#`).
- Main sections: **3-8 headings** (`##`) covering the major ideas.
- Subpoints (`###`) only when truly needed; minor details go as bullets.
- **Do not create unnecessary headings** — each heading must represent a meaningful node.
- Each heading = **one-sentence summary with key info**, not a vague or generic title. Start with **one relevant emoji**.
  - ❌ Bad: "Diet Tips"
  - ✅ Good: "🥗 Eating omega-3 rich fish and antioxidant foods boosts memory"
- Keep it **concise and information-dense** — maximum useful info in minimum words.
- Include only info from the original text — no additions.
- Use bullet points for lists, fenced code blocks for code, markdown for formulas.
- Group related points and keep sections balanced in length.
